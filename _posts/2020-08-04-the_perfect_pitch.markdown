Hello tech world, this is Chef Tharon learning how to blog! I've been cooking my whole life, I come from a family of chefs, food is life, passion, harmony, creativity and love. At least that's what I thought... 

Over the past 10 years I have been in every kind of kitchen, from 24-hour diner to one of the top fine dining steak houses in the US. I was the executive sous chef at the oldest country club west of the Mississippi river and till just recently the executive of a high-end hotel and spa. I'd like to think I've been pretty successful as a Chef but that didnâ€™t come without a toll both physically and mentally.

Which leads us here. As I get older and my family gets bigger, time and quality of life becomes more and more valuable. The 15 hour shifts of dealing with high stress levels and knowing that the next day would be no different has to come to an end. I'm tired, I'm sore, and I miss my family. Que the light bulb. 

I chased and conquered one childhood dream, one that was literally full of blood sweat and tears, why not do it again!? I had always had a deep fascination with games, the complex stories accompanied by breath taking visuals and beautiful audio. I wrote stories, drew characters, dreamed I was them in a turn-based RPG or side scroller.

So why not? What's stopping me? When would be a better time? Life throws us pitches, some may be a curve ball high which is almost unhittable, but then there's that perfect pitch right down the center. Do you swing and rip that ball out the park or do you just let it zoom right on by?  Life has thrown me that perfect pitch. Now's the time I gather all my strength and send that ball flying. Will I come around the bases and return home a video game engineer?  Probably not but I will be one home run closer. Just like the game of baseball, life is long and full of innings, some exciting and full of dingers, sometimes you strike out, but you'll never have a chance of winning unless you take that swing.
